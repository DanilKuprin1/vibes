Design:

the user types their current vibe into the box and is instantly paired with a person who matches their vibe. Right? We go back from tinder swipe style to instant matching system, which is fine??? Yes, it's fine. 

so we have instant matching + people who currently chat may receive additional messages when their vibes match?


how do we match a person who submitted their vibe? We can do place them with somebody who is already on the platform and maybe not even online. but ideally we need to place them right with the person who is online and who is also looking for someone with the exact vibe match. 
No tinder stuff? Swipping left and right profiles? - but like okay so the only thing we have for a single profile is the vibe they inputed so they got to read profile cards with just a bunch of text that describes their vibe? that's not even description of a person. But will it work? Well it's a hussle, so let's reduce the hussle. 
Instant matching with solid vibe match is definetely a good stuff and is what we should aim for. So let's implement it.
how instant is it? 4seconds?

as idea: vibes people input will not be shared with others, it's only used for matching but not disclosed any further.

how many ppl do we need to have to have a smooth/almost instant matching between people who are right now looking for a chat/match.

let's say a match should take 5 seconds

We need matching between users who are already on the platform with users who are just coming here for sure.
so people who are already on the platform will get paired with people who are just coming, with some limit set 



flow for user submitting the vibe on the front page:
- an account gets created for the user
- person is matched with someone who is also currently online or currently looking for someone to vibe with.
- they are transfered to a page where they have a list of chats UI.
- they see a first chat with the person whose vibe matched with theirs.
- they can enter that chat and start talking.



idea: we have a "vibing" toogle that specifies wheather a person want to get new chats/people with whom their vibes match.
idea: have a toggle to vibe with people that are close to you.
